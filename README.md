connect database to get data to print labels
I use React to connect database with some codes in PHP
in PHP, there are some functions getAll data from table, add new products to table named "labels"
And printing labels as I use JSBarcode
I still got problem to use JSBarcode directly in React, I installed by npm but when I used, it shows errors "Encoder is not constructor"
I tried but I couldn't figure out how to use it so I use JSBarcode in PHP (as I want to help my husband printing label of product in his grocery store

===========
I keep working on React, PHP and I have found Redux is quite interesting, I won't give up solving problem and learning something new related to database
